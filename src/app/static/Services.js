It uses flat metal electrodes placed on your chest to detect the electrical charges generated by your heart as it beats, which are then graphed. Your doctor can analyze the patterns to get a better understanding of your heart rate and heart rhythm, identify some types of structural heart disease, and evaluate cardiac efficiency.</p><br></br><p>In a conventional 12-lead ECG, ten electrodes are placed on the patient’s limbs and on the surface of the chest.
